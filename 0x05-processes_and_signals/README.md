# Processes and signals

## What's a process ?

A process is an executing (i.e., running) instance of a program. Each process is guaranteed a unique PID, which is always a non-negative integer.

### Types of Processes in Linux :

- **Foreground Processes** :
depend on the user for input, also referred to as interactive processes.

- **Foreground Processes** :
referred to as non-interactive or automatic processes.

## What's a signal ?

is an event generated by the UNIX and Linux systems in response to some condition. Upon receipt of a signal, a process may take action.

### Two types of signals :

- **Maskable**: signals which can be changed or ignored by the user (e.g., Ctrl+C).
- **Non-maskable**: signals which cannot be changed or ignored by the user. These typically occur when the user is signaled for non-recoverable hardware errors.

### Signals Lists :

| **Signal** | **Description** |
|------------|-----------------|
| SIGHUP     | Hang-up detected on controlling terminal or death of controlling process. |
| SIGINT     | Issued if the user sends an interrupt signal (Ctrl + C). |
| SIGQUIT    | Issued if the user sends a quit signal (Ctrl + D). |
| SIGFPE     | Issued if an illegal mathematical operation is attempted. |
| SIGKILL    | If a process gets this signal, it must quit immediately and will not perform any clean-up operations. |
| SIGTERM    | Software termination signal (sent kill by default). |
| SIGALRM    | Alarm clock signal (used for timers). |
